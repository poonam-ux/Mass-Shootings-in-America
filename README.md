# Mass-Shootings-in-America

### What this project is about?
For this project I chose to analyze and visualize mass shootings in America over the last 40 years. The data was collected from Mother Jones website in a CSV format. Some of the key attributes of the incidents are, fatalities and injuries, location, shooter’s demographics and mental health, and weapons used. 

### Process:

* Data collection and Cleaning
* Preliminary data analysis and visualization in Jupyter Notebook
* Python Flask - Defining API Routes 
* Dashboard Design 
* Backend Development 

### Project Requirements:

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database.
2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
    * A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
    * A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
    * A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
    * A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
